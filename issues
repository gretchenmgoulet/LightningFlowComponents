Navigation button Flow Component:
I'm finding that the button clicked variables are not being set when I click on the buttons in a flow that I have running in a preview of Winter '23. 
The exact same flow running in production is working fine (the variables are set and I am able to fork based on their settings)
Could there be an issue with Winter '23 and these buttons?
